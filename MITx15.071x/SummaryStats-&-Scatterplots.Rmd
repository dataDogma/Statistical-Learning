## About

The following markdown is curated from an online course MITx15.071x-Analytics Edge. This markdown will be specifically for "Summary Statistics" & "Scatterplots".

-- -- 
> **What is a summary statistic?**
A 'Summary Statistics is a set of data values collected by a survey or experiment is known as a sample. In short they provide useful info about sample data.

Most common of them being Measure of Central Tendency(Average), and measure of spread(standard deviation)


## Objective

In this markdown we are going to discuss the following topics:

1. **Summary Statistics**
    + Creating a summary statistics.
2. **Data Visualization**
    + Histograms
    + Boxplots
    + Scatterplots

## Implementation

> **Importing our data set "WHO.csv"**

```{r}
WHO <- read.csv("C:/Users/pySag/Desktop/Major_Project_Summer_2016/Sectorwise_Data_Sets/Health & Family welfare/WHO.csv")
```

> **Summary Statistics on "WHO dataset"**

```{r}
summary(WHO)

# Let's pull out summary stats for info on "populaton under 15 years of age"
# If we simply type **Under15**, R will throw back an error "Object Under15 not found".
# Hence to access the variable "Under15" we have to call it implicitly using our data frame "WHO".
# Syntax: DataFrame $ Data frame variable name.

summary(WHO$Under15)
```

-- -- 
> **Understanding the summary statistics for "Population under 15"**

1. Output tells us that there is a country with  minimum of 13% population under 15 & a country with maximum of 49.99% of population.
    * **Question** is which are those countries?
2. Output also tells us that some of the country have values below 1st quartile.
3. Further there are some countries who have population under 15 below 3rd quarile.
4. At last, an average of 28.73% of population lie below that value, is under 15.


> **What is IQR(Inter Quartile Range) and what does 1st IQ and 3rd IQ mean?**

In descriptive statistics, the interquartile range (IQR), also called the midspread or middle fifty, is a measure of statistical dispersion, being equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles, IQR = Q3 - Q1.

Where 1st Qurtile = 
& 3rd Quartile = 

-- --

> **Which countries have min and max of population under 15?**

To answer this, R provides us with some useful function called **which.min() & which.max()**, here the following will give the information we want to absorb.

```{r}
which.min(WHO $ Under15)

# R throws an output "86" which simply is the index of the variable in our data frame.
# Just like most of the programming langugages, we have to use this index to extract the answer that we are intersested in finding!

WHO $ Country[86]

#Now lets find the country with maximum % of population under 15!

which.max(WHO $ Under15)
WHO $ Country[124]
```

> **Plotting a Scatterplot of GNI vs Firtility Rate**

Before plotting a "Scatterplot", let's understand what a scatterplot is.
Here's what statistics say about scatterplots:

```{r, echo = TRUE}
library(plotly)
```
``` {r}
plot_ly(data = WHO, x = WHO$GNI, y = WHO$FertilityRate, mode = "markers", color = WHO$GNI)
```

**NOTE:** Each point in the scatter plot is a _country_. We can see that most countries here either have a low GNI or a high GNI but a low fertility rate. However, there are a few countries for which both the GNI and the fertility rate are high.

__Let's Investigate!__

-- --

> ## Investigation

We will use the another function offered by R to identify the countries
with a GNI greater than 10,000, and a fertility rate greater than 2.5.

```{r}
Outliers <- subset(WHO, GNI > 10000 & FertilityRate > 2.5)
# Using our outlier we can tell how many countries have such anamoly.

nrow(Outliers)
```
-- -- 
** What are the names of those coutries?**
There's an easy way of doing this in R, we can do this by **accessing** the _index_ within our _Outlier_ with a [], inside this [C("variable names to extract")]

``` {r}
Outliers[c("Country", "GNI", "FertilityRate")]
```
