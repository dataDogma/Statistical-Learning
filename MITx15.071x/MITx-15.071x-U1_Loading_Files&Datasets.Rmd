## ABOUT:
--- --- 

Often as a Data Analyst, one has to work with **_external data files and data sets_**.
Some common data file formats are as follows:

* __.csv__ or _Commma Seperated Values ~ variables_.
* __.xml__ or _Extensible markup language_ files.
* __.json__ or _Javascript object notation_.
* __.txt__ or _simple text_.

As for today, we are going to work with only __.csv__ files.



## Objective:
--- ---

* Loading a .csv file from an external location using command line in R console.
    + Prelimanary:
        + Viewing current working directory.
        + Setting working directory to data file ~ data set path.


## Implementation
--- ---

> __Viewing Current Working directory__, _command_ : **getwd()**

```{r}
getwd()
```

> __Setting Current Working directory__ to __data set/ data file__ path.

``` {r}

# Lest's view the files which we want to import. For this session we would like to import "WHO.csv"
list.files()

# Also a good idea will be to save our workspace for frequent usage of our data files.
save.image()
```

__NOTE__ : Everytime you want to work with a data file, you have to manually set the directory again each time. This is the only issue with the R markdown, but until somebody finds a way to resolve this issue we have to manage things on our own.
__Update!__ : Using __Knitr::opts_knit$set(root.dir = "insert working directory path")__. It will set the working directory for all code chunks!

> __Loading__ the data set/data file_ with R built in function, __read.csv()__
``` {r}
WHO <- read.csv("WHO.csv")
```

> __Viewing the Summary of our data file__

A good way to look at our data without getting ourselves into it's complexity is by summarizing our data as a summary statistics.

We can do this by two functions offered by R. Following are the two functions that we are going to use:

1. **summary()**
2. **structure**


```{r}
summary(WHO)
```

**Note**: While we can use structure(), using in R markdown document is not a good idea. Why? because it will return a table of all atrributes and will make things messy. Hence we refrain ourselves for using structure(). It is best utilized in Rstudio console only.

##Analysis:

If we look at the summary of our "WHO" data set, it has 195 obv. of 13 variables.
Some variables are distinctive, for example **Country** & **Region** has **factor** data type.

> A **Factor** data type contains categorical data aswell as numerical data binded into single entity called _Factor_.

We also have some variables with missing values, such type of missing entitys are marked as **NA**.
Missing values can generated error and don't help in data analysis. Hence a good thing will be to replace these with normalized values of other similar variables.
