#### In Previous recitation, we did the following:

* #### Created new variables.

* #### Added to our data frame "USDA".

* #### These variables were namely:

    * #### HighSodium.
    * #### HighFat.
    * #### HighCarbs.
    * #### HighProtein.

> ## Outline

#### In this session, we are going to discuss the following things:

* #### Understanding our data more closely.

* #### Identifying relationships b/w our variables.

    * #### How? By using __table()__ & __tapply()__ functions.

* #### Answering the following question:

    * #### To figure out how many foods have High Sodium level than average?
    
        * #### By looking at the HighSodium variable and count the foods that have value 1.

> ## Analysis

--- ---

Let's find out how many food have High Sodium content and How many doesn't.


--- ---

``` {r comm}
# Loading our data set.

USDA <- read.csv("C:/Users/pySag/Desktop/MITx15.071x/Datasets/USDA.csv")
str(USDA)

# Counting High Sodium values.

table(USDA $ HighSodium)

# Let's see how many foods have both high sodium & high fat.

table(USDA $ HighSodium, USDA $ HighFat)
## 1st row belogs to 1st input argument and coloumn correspond to 2nd input.
```

--- ---

> #### **[ INFERENCE ]:** Interpreting our previous result as follows:

* #### 3,529 foods  ----------- __low__ sodium & __low__ fat.

* #### 1,355 foods  ----------- __low__ sodium but __high__ fat.

* #### 1,378 foods  ----------- __high__ sodium but __low__ fat.

  * #### 712 foods  ----------- __both__, __high__ sodium & __high__ fat.

#### What if we want to compute the average amount of iron sorted by high and low protein?

#### We can do this by following way:

* #### Using tapply() to extract info on iron variable in our USDA data frame.

* #### Then providing 2nd arguments as both high and low protein.

* #### Followed by a 3rd argument, mean.

#### Lets take this for a spin in our r chunk.

--- ---

``` {r}

# Lets compute the avg. amount of Iron sorted by Protein levels.
tapply( USDA $ Iron, USDA $ HighProtein, mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# Now, lets compute the max. amount of "Vitamin C" sorted by high & low Carbohydrate

tapply( USDA $ VitaminC, USDA $ HighCarb, max, na.rm = TRUE)

```

--- ---

#### __Inference:__ What exactly does __tapply__ do?

--- ---

### **The following observations are made:**

1. #### The first tapply() computes the average amount of Iron sorted by High Protein levels.

2. #### The 2nd tapply() computes the maximum amount of "VitaminC" sorted by High & Low Carbohydrates.

> #### __How about investigating whether food with High Carbs have generally High Vitamin C content or vice-versa?__

--- ---

#### To do this, we will make just a small change in our previous code.

* #### Instead Using 'max' function, we will use 'summary'.
    * #### This will give us a statistical info or clear picture to support or reject our claim.
    
--- ---

``` {r}

tapply( USDA $ VitaminC, USDA $ HighCarb, summary, na.rm = TRUE)

```

--- ---

> ## __Conclusion__

--- ---

#### From the former results, we can say the following:

* #### ***In general, Foods with High Carbs are on average richer in vitamin C***
    * #### As compared to foods with Low Carbs content.
