# DETECTING FLU EPIDEMICS VIA SEARCH ENGINE QUERY DATA 

# PROBLEM 1 - UNDERSTANDING THE DATA

# Which week corresponds to the highest percentage of ILI-related physician visits?

# Which week corresponds to the highest percentage of ILI-related query fraction?

# What best describes the distribution of values of ILI?
hist(FluTrain$ILI)
# Answer based on the plot of the above function
# Plot the natural logarithm of ILI versus Queries. What does the plot suggest?.
plot(log(FluTrain$ILI), FluTrain$Queries)

# PROBLEM 2 - LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL  
# Based on our understanding of the data from the previous subproblem, which model best describes our estimation problem?
FluTrend1 <- lm(formula=log(ILI) ~ Queries, data=FluTrain)

# Answer based on the the above function
# What is the training set R-squared value for FluTrend1 model (the "Multiple R-squared")?
cor(log(FluTrain$ILI),FluTrain$Queries)
# For a single variable linear regression model, there is a direct relationship between the R-squared and the correlation
# between the independent and the dependent variables. What is the relationship we infer from our problem?
# Answer based on actual calculation of each function provided

# We are instead interested in obtaining predictions of the ILI value. We can convert from predictions of log(ILI) to 
# predictions of ILI via exponentiation, or the exp() function. The new code, which predicts the ILI value, is
PredTest1 = exp(predict(FluTrend1, newdata=FluTest))
# What is our estimate for the percentage of ILI-related physician visits for the week of March 11, 2012?
which(FluTest$Week=="2012-03-11 - 2012-03-17")

# Note that the relative error is calculated as (Observed ILI - Estimated ILI)/Observed ILI
(FluTest[11,"ILI"] - PredTest1[11])/FluTest[11,"ILI"]
# What is the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between our estimates and the actual observations for the percentage of 
# ILI-related physician visits, on the test set?

# Answer based on the result of the function above
# On the basis of R-squared value and significance of coefficients, which statement is the most accurate?
# Due to overfitting, FluTrend2 is a weaker model then FluTrend1 on the training set.
# FluTrend2 is about the same quality as FluTrend1 on the training set.
